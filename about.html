            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am a passionate and dedicated web developer with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies. My journey in the tech world began with a curiosity to understand how things work on the web, and it has since evolved into a deep commitment to creating seamless, efficient, and scalable web applications.</p>

            <h3>My Expertise:</h3>
            <p>I am proficient in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), which allows me to build full-stack applications from scratch. My skills in Java and JavaScript have equipped me with a solid understanding of programming logic and problem-solving techniques, while my knowledge of data structures and algorithms in Java ensures that I can write optimized and efficient code.

                On the frontend, I specialize in creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces using React, complemented by my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. My experience with these technologies enables me to design and develop websites that are not only visually appealing but also provide a great user experience.
                
                On the backend, I excel in building robust server-side applications using Node.js and Express. My ability to connect these applications to databases, particularly MongoDB, ensures that the data flow between the frontend and backend is smooth and secure. I am also well-versed in the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, which helps me maintain organized and scalable code.</p>
            <h3>My Journey:</h3>
            <p>After completing certifications in MERN Stack Development and Data Structures & Algorithms from Coding Ninjas, I began applying my knowledge by working on real-world projects. One of the pivotal moments in my career was when I started developing products by following tutorials on YouTube in 2022-23. This hands-on experience not only boosted my confidence but also provided me with valuable insights into how technology works in real-time scenarios. Eventually, I started creating my own projects, which further deepened my understanding of web development.</p>
            <h3>My Approach:</h3>
            <p>I believe in continuous learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends. Whether it's solving coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode or exploring new frameworks and tools, I am always eager to expand my skill set. My ability to communicate effectively in both English and Hindi allows me to collaborate efficiently with diverse teams and clients.

                I am not just a developer; I am a problem-solver. I thrive on challenges and take pride in delivering high-quality, scalable solutions that meet user needs. I am always open to exploring new opportunities and am excited to contribute to innovative projects that make a difference.</p>
            <h3>Letâ€™s Connect:</h3>
            <p>I am currently seeking roles where I can leverage my skills to contribute to exciting and meaningful projects. If you're looking for a dedicated and skilled web developer who is eager to learn and grow, feel free to reach out. I look forward to the possibility of working together and making an impact through technology.</p>
